## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **No Active Volunteers?**
**Solution:** Volunteers need to toggle their status to "Active" in their dashboard

### **Can't Assign Delivery?**
**Possible reasons:**
- No active volunteers available
- Donation not claimed yet
- Donation already has volunteer assigned

### **Verification Not Working?**
**Check:**
- Ride status is "pending_verification"
- You have admin permissions
- Firebase rules are applied correctly

### **Volunteer Stats Not Updating?**
**Solution:** Stats update automatically after verification. If not updating:
- Check Firebase console for errors
